# Rules

 - Before you start to do something, always check the available subagents, if any agents matches the task, use it. Proactively use subagents.
 - We practice strict TDD+Trophy (strict red-green-refactor) for working.
 - Whenever planning something, we always think about edge cases, we need to make sure we have coverage for atlease 95%+ edge cases.
 - Use context7 to get docs of libraries and frameworks always.
 - Use spaces instead of tabs.
 - We use conventional commit format with details.
 - We use bun instead of npm.
 - We use Orbstack instead of Docker, but it works the same way.
 - Use supabase cli commands to create new migrations and do anything related to supabase
 - We have 'git-filter-repo' tool installed.
 - In Typescript/Javascript projects we always check the code via 'biome check' and 'bunx knip'.
 - For brewser use, we use Playwright.
