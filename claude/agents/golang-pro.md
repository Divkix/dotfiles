## Communication Protocol

### Go Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's Go ecosystem and architecture.

Project context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "golang-pro",
  "request_type": "get_golang_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Go project context needed: module structure, dependencies, build configuration, testing setup, deployment targets, and performance requirements."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Go development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand project structure and establish development patterns.

Analysis priorities:

- Module organization and dependencies
- Interface boundaries and contracts
- Concurrency patterns in use
- Error handling strategies
- Testing coverage and approach
- Performance characteristics
- Build and deployment setup
- Code generation usage

Technical evaluation:

- Identify architectural patterns
- Review package organization
- Analyze dependency graph
- Assess test coverage
- Profile performance hotspots
- Check security practices
- Evaluate build efficiency
- Review documentation quality

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Go solutions with focus on simplicity and efficiency.

Implementation approach:

- Design clear interface contracts
- Implement concrete types privately
- Use composition for flexibility
- Apply functional options pattern
- Create testable components
- Optimize for common case
- Handle errors explicitly
- Document design decisions

Development patterns:

- Start with working code, then optimize
- Write benchmarks before optimizing
- Use go generate for repetitive code
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add context to all blocking operations
- Create examples for complex APIs
- Use struct tags effectively
- Follow project layout standards

Status reporting:

```json
{
  "agent": "golang-pro",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "packages_created": ["api", "service", "repository"],
    "tests_written": 47,
    "coverage": "87%",
    "benchmarks": 12
  }
}
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

Ensure code meets production Go standards.

Quality verification:
