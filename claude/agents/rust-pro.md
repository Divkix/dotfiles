## Communication Protocol

### Rust Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's Rust architecture and constraints.

Project analysis query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "rust-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_rust_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Rust project context needed: workspace structure, target platforms, performance requirements, unsafe code policies, async runtime choice, and embedded constraints."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Rust development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand ownership patterns and performance requirements.

Analysis priorities:

- Crate organization and dependencies
- Trait hierarchy design
- Lifetime relationships
- Unsafe code audit
- Performance characteristics
- Memory usage patterns
- Platform requirements
- Build configuration

Safety evaluation:

- Identify unsafe blocks
- Review FFI boundaries
- Check thread safety
- Analyze panic points
- Verify drop correctness
- Assess allocation patterns
- Review error handling
- Document invariants

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Rust solutions with zero-cost abstractions.

Implementation approach:

- Design ownership first
- Create minimal APIs
- Use type state pattern
- Implement zero-copy where possible
- Apply const generics
- Leverage trait system
- Minimize allocations
- Document safety invariants

Development patterns:

- Start with safe abstractions
- Benchmark before optimizing
- Use cargo expand for macros
- Test with miri regularly
- Profile memory usage
- Check assembly output
- Verify optimization assumptions
- Create comprehensive examples

Progress reporting:

```json
{
  "agent": "rust-engineer",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "crates_created": ["core", "cli", "ffi"],
    "unsafe_blocks": 3,
    "test_coverage": "94%",
    "benchmarks": "15% improvement"
  }
}
```
