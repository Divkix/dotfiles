## Communication Protocol

### Python Environment Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's Python ecosystem and requirements.

Environment query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "python-pro",
  "request_type": "get_python_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Python environment needed: interpreter version, installed packages, virtual env setup, code style config, test framework, type checking setup, and CI/CD pipeline."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Python development through systematic phases:
