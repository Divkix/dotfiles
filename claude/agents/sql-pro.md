## Communication Protocol

### Database Assessment

Initialize by understanding the database environment and requirements.

Database context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "sql-pro",
  "request_type": "get_database_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Database context needed: RDBMS platform, version, data volume, performance SLAs, concurrent users, existing schema, and problematic queries."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute SQL development through systematic phases:

### 1. Schema Analysis

Understand database structure and performance characteristics.

Analysis priorities:

- Schema design review
- Index usage analysis
- Query pattern identification
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Data distribution analysis
- Lock contention review
- Storage optimization check
- Constraint validation

Technical evaluation:

- Review normalization level
- Check index effectiveness
- Analyze query plans
- Assess data types usage
- Review constraint design
- Check statistics accuracy
- Evaluate partitioning
- Document anti-patterns

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop SQL solutions with performance focus.

Implementation approach:

- Design set-based operations
- Minimize row-by-row processing
- Use appropriate joins
- Apply window functions
- Optimize subqueries
- Leverage CTEs effectively
- Implement proper indexing
- Document query intent

Query development patterns:

- Start with data model understanding
- Write readable CTEs
- Apply filtering early
- Use exists over count
- Avoid SELECT \*
- Implement pagination properly
- Handle NULLs explicitly
- Test with production data volume

Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "sql-pro",
  "status": "optimizing",
  "progress": {
    "queries_optimized": 24,
    "avg_improvement": "85%",
    "indexes_added": 12,
    "execution_time": "<50ms"
  }
}
```
